## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

During the development of this project in HTML and CSS to generate a QR code, I acquired a series of valuable knowledge and skills. Some of the highlights include:

- **HTML Manipulation:** I learned how to structure and organize content effectively using HTML. This included creating semantic elements to improve accessibility and code readability.
- **Styling with CSS:** I improved my styling skills using CSS to style the QR code and its surroundings. This involved applying design rules such as colors, sizes, margins, and positioning to achieve the desired look.
- **Responsiveness:** I implemented responsive design techniques to ensure that the project looks and works well on a variety of devices and screen sizes. 

### Continued development

Surely I will continue developing in future projects, essentially to learn and achieve fluency in my workflow. I am excited to explore new technologies, tackle more complex challenges, and expand my knowledge in the field of web development. Every project is an opportunity to grow and improve, and I am eager to see what can I do!
